GAME IDEA:
Sik (possibly Cold Season)
bacteria game, infect all cells, stay away from white-blood-cells
goal is to get the kid to stay home from school

- white blood cells have to surround you if they are weaker than you

LEVEL IDEAS
- sinuses: air w/ low resistance (makes you move really fast), maybe somehow find the entrance?
    - nostril hairs/cells standing guard?
- lungs: air bubbles, slight flow
- arteries: flowing, have to stay on the screen
- heart: strong flows
- brain: electrical shocks

- bonus level to ride a sneeze to the next person?
